## Hello, pleased to meet you !

<img src="./wallpapersden.com_heart-of-deimos-warframe_2560x1440.jpg" width="200" align="right" />

I’m Lyzer, I am 20 years old Software Engineer, currently in second year at **[@Epitech](https://github.com/Epitech)**.
My passion lies in language syntax analysis as well as low-level programming languages such as **C, C++** as well as **DevOps** and **AdminSys**. I have a strong interest in software development/design in general.

I began coding at school when I was 11 using Scratch. I later taught myself **Python** at 16. My formal education introduced me to **C**, which has since become my primary language.

I work on both academic and personal projects. Among my favorites is my take on **[Wolfenstein3d](https://github.com/lyzer-px/Wolfenstein3d)**, developed prior to the release of the well-known **[Doom](https://www.google.com/search?q=doom+1)** game.
Additionally, I created **[Libmeta](https://github.com/lyzer-px/libmeta-3)**, my own implementation of parts of the standard C library, which has proven invaluable during my studies.

### Ambitions

I aspire to develop software that addresses real-world challenges and benefits a wide audience. I am particularly inspired by 🐳 **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**, a company with roots at my school, and I aim to make a similar impact on the developer community.

### Operating Systems
I use ubuntu/windows on a daily basis, but I worked with all of the OS below
